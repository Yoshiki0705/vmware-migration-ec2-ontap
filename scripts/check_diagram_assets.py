"""Fail when the committed architecture diagrams have drifted from their build.

Why this exists
---------------
`tools/build_diagrams.py` already refuses to finish on a missing icon, an untranslated
label, unparseable XML or a cell that never landed. None of that runs in CI: the build
needs the AWS Architecture Icons package, which is deliberately not in this repository,
and the draw.io desktop app to export. So every one of those guarantees holds only on the
machine that last ran the build, and nothing notices when the committed artifacts stop
matching it.

What is checked here is the subset that needs neither icons nor a renderer:

  1. No icon-library file has been committed. AWS licenses the assets for use in a
     diagram, not for redistribution, so `Arch_*`, `Res_*` and the package directory must
     never appear in the tree.
  2. Every figure has all of its artifacts. Editing the spec and rerunning without
     --export leaves the `.drawio` newer than the `.svg` and `.png` the documents embed,
     and the documents keep showing the stale picture.
  3. No Japanese character survives in an English artifact. This is the one failure the
     build's own residue gate cannot catch retroactively: a label added to LABELS
     incorrectly, or a `.drawio` hand-edited after generation, shows up here.

What it cannot check: whether the `.svg` was exported from the `.drawio` beside it. Git
stores no timestamps and there is no renderer available, so a `.drawio` change committed
without a re-export passes item 2 as long as the old files exist. Look at the PNG.

Exit codes: 0 the artifacts are consistent, 1 something drifted.
