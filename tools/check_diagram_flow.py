"""Fail when a diagram makes the reader work out which way to read it.

Three rules, all of them things that are only visible in the rendered image and therefore easy to
break while every generator function still looks correct.

**Direction.** Every edge must advance rightwards or downwards, never leftwards and never upwards.
The failure this prevents is not ugliness. A figure whose arrows change heading part-way through has
no reading order, so a reader traces each line with a finger to find out which one carries the thing
they came for -- which is usually the one claim the figure exists to make. A single backwards edge is
enough to cost that, because once one line runs the other way the reader can no longer assume any of
the others.

The verdict is reached on the two points the edge actually joins: the exit and entry anchors when the
style fixes them, and the node centres otherwise. Not on the routed path -- draw.io computes
orthogonal routing at render time and the waypoints are not in the file, so the path cannot be
recovered here.

Reading the anchors matters wherever an edge lands on something large. A restore edge dropping onto
the top-right of a 520px boundary frame advances rightwards for the reader while the frame's *centre*
sits well to the left of where the edge left, so a centres-only rule reports a backwards edge that
renders forwards. The anchors are in the file, so there is no reason to guess.

**Icon labels.** A vertex drawn as an image must carry `verticalLabelPosition=bottom`. The official
AWS asset guidance puts a service's name under its icon, and every reader of these diagrams has
learned that convention from every other AWS diagram they have seen. A label beside an icon reads as
belonging to whatever else is on that row.

**Boundary labels.** A group frame's title must not be pushed sideways with `spacingLeft` past the
standard offset. Raising it is how a boundary's name ends up sitting next to an icon that is merely
inside the boundary, which then looks exactly like that icon's own label while the icon's real label
sits underneath -- two names, one of them wrong.

Crossing edges are deliberately not checked. Whether two lines cross depends on the routing, which
is not in the file, and approximating it with straight centre-to-centre segments reports crossings
that do not render and misses ones that do. The direction rule removes most of them anyway: lines
that all advance the same way have far fewer opportunities to meet.

Nothing here is specific to one repository: paths are discovered rather than configured, so this file
is copied between repositories as-is. Two things then differ, both of them known. The suppression on
the parse call in `_parse()`: a repository whose ruff selects `S` needs `# noqa: S314` there, and one
that selects `RUF100` without `S` rejects the same comment as unused, so the divergence is isolated to
that one function rather than left to spread. And the line wrapping, because each repository's ruff
carries its own line length and reformats the copy on arrival -- so the copies are the same logic and
not the same bytes, and a diff between two of them is expected to show re-wrapped statements.

There is no debt file. This gate was wired only after every figure in the repository passed it, so
there is nothing to carry, and a gate with no exemption list cannot grow one quietly.
